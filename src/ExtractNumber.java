//Extract the Number from the String
//Given a sentence containing several words and numbers. Find the largest number among them which does not contain 9. If no such number exists, return -1.
//Note: Numbers and words are separated by spaces only. It is guaranteed that there are no leading zeroes in the answer.

//Examples :
//Input: sentence="This is alpha 5057 and 97"
//Output: 5057
//Explanation: 5057 is the only number that does not have a 9.
